    <p>Two hunters were walking through the forest one day. All of the sudden, one 
    of them passes out. The other hunter panics and dials 911. The emergency 
    responder says “911, whats your emergency?” The hunter replies “My friend 
    just passed out and I don’t know what to do! I think he might be dead!” The

    born.” The next calf comes up and asks, “Momma, why is my name Lily?” The

    your head." The final baby walks over and says, “Huh Ruh Buh Duh!” The momma
